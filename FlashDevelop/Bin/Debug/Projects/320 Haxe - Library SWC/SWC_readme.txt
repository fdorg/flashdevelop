SWC notes:

1. In order to use a Haxe-compiled SWC in AS3, you will first need to initialize the Haxe system before doing anything else, by calling:

haxe.initSwc(mc);

Example:

SwcMain.hx:
=8<======================
package;

class SwcMain
{
	static function main()
	{
		trace("swc::init");
	}

	static function foo()
	{
		trace("swc::foo");
	}
}
=>8======================

Main.as3:
=8<======================
package
{
	import flash.display.MovieClip;
	public class Main extends MovieClip
	{
		public function Main()
		{
			trace("app::Main");
			haxe.initSwc(this);
			SwcMain.foo();
		}
	}
}
=>8======================

Output:
[Starting debug session with FDB]
app::Main
SwcMain.hx:12: swc::init
SwcMain.hx:17: swc::foo

2. To include source from package, place package in project classpath directory and then add the option "--macro include('package.name')" to "Additional Compiler Options". With this approach, the "Main Class" option is optional and can be removed (along with SwcMain.hx).

3. There are issues with SWC written in Haxe 4.x. But SWC should work with Haxe 3.4.7.
