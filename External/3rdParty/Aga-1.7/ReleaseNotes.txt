1.7.0.1 (r98)
[r98] Fixed: Issue #44 - tree nodes are now properly saved and restored when 'ITreeModel.StructureChanged' event is raised.
[r97] Fixed: Issue #23, added support for whole page mouse scrolling
[r96] Added: Option to choose custom highlight colors
[r95] Fixed: Issue #48 UseCompatibleTextRendering is backwards

[r90] Fixed: Incorrect behavior of TreeViewAdv.ColumnHeaderHeight property, logic and design is now separated.
[r89] Option to modify node visibility via callback
[r88] NodeTextBox: Process Enter, Escape Key as Input Key.
[r87] NodesInserted and NodesRemoved events now supports the case, when the parent has not been loaded.
[r86] added ColumnHeaderHeight, AutoHeaderHeight Property. 
 Used default for AutoHeaderHeight False (not as in patch used).
[r85] When the last child of an item is removed it becomes to be a leaf. in this case, parentNode.Nodes.Clear() was not called and the child is not removed from Nodes list. (bug in ReadChilds method).
[r84] bugfix of bugfix
[r83] Bug while restoring the Selection after StructureChange is now fixed (hopefully definitely). Laurent Nicot, thanks for the detailed feedback and the Test-Case.
[r82] Fixed a bug: selected nodes were not correctly restored after structure change event.
[r81] EnsureVisible(TreeNodeAdv node) does not fail in case the node parameter is the root node.
[r80] Bugfix: StructureChange missed to clear _selection on restore (causing invalid SelectedNode in case the selection path is not found anymore).
[r79] prevent unneeded selection change event on structure change
[r78] Don't reset scroll position on structure change.
[r77] Fix threading problem with _expandingNodes related to AbortBackgroundExpandingThreads() 
[r76] - FIX: Redraw when Focus Lost ( to update selection color from active to inactive).
- NEW: Property InactiveSelection on TreeViewAdv to choose if selection gets inactive or not when unfocused.
 - FIX: Try to Restore Selection when StructureChanged
[r75] NodeCheckBox has a new Property ReverseCheckOrder: changes the order from Indeterminate, Unchecked, Checked to Indeterminate, Checked, Unchecked.
[r74] TreeViewAdv.cs, TreeViewAdv.Designer.cs: moved and completed Dispose method. Unregister events on dispose to prevent memory-leaks: ExpandingIcon.IconChanged event to static Object was never unregistered -> tree view was not collected by garbage collection until application quits.
