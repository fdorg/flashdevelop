    <h3>Artistic Style 2.06&nbsp; (Pending)</h3>

    <p>
        A new option, &quot;pad&#8209;comma&quot;, will add a space following a comma. The option &quot;pad&#8209;oper&quot;
        has not been changed and will also add a space following a comma.
    </p>
    <p>
        All spaces before a comma are now removed. Use the disable block comments if there are arrays with vertical alignment
        where this is not wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
        New Objective&#8209;C options "pad&#8209;return&#8209;type" and &quot;unpad&#8209;return&#8209;type&quot; will
        add or remove space padding after the Objective&#8209;C return type. It is described in the "Objective&#8209;C"
        section of the documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Objective&#8209;C align&#8209;method&#8209;colon has been changed for method declarations and definitions.
        For multi&#8209;line arguments when the first keyword is shorter than the others the colons are aligned on the
        longest line instead of the first line. The alignment includes room for the indentation. This aligns all colons
        after the first line for a better appaerance. Arguments that do not have a short keyword in the first line will
        remain the same. This style conforms to the Google Objective&#8209;C Style Guide.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Objective&#8209;C align&#8209;method&#8209;colon option is now applied to Objective&#8209;C method calls in
        addition to method declarations and definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Processing for c++14 single&#8209;quote digit separators has been added.
    </p>

    <h4>
        New
        Software License
    </h4>

    <p>
        The Artisic Style software license has changed. It is now under the MIT license. This is a permissive license
        which can be used in proprietory software and does NOT require modified Artistic Style source code be made available.
        It is compatable with the GNU General Public License (GPL) and most other software licenses. The change was made
        to remove restrictions on using the software and to make it available for any project that wants to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
        If there are problems with the license change send an email to Artistic Style and its use will be approved on
        a individual basis.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Assignment Operator Alignment
    </h4>

    <p>
        Visual Studio 2013 and 2015 have an Edit option &quot;Align Assignments&quot; that will align assignment operators
        across multiple lines. There is also an extension named &quot;Code alignment&quot; that will align the code on
        other items as well. Other development environments may have something similar. These will selectively align the
        data and allow for customization of the format.
    </p>
    <p>
        These options and extensions can be used with Artistic Style. If you choose to do this, the space padding will
        be maintained and the alignment will be preserved.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Microsoft Clang Compiler
    </h4>


    <p>
        The Microsoft Clang Compiler is available with Visual Studio 2015 Update 1. It is usually 
        used for Android or iOS
        support but the CodeGen support can be used with Windows. The Clang Update 1 version is a preview and is 
        incomplete, but can be used if you want. It will require modification of the Visual Studio 2015 project files.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Clang compiler can be installed from the Visual Studio 2015 install program by selecting the &quot;Clang
        with Microsoft CodeGen&quot; option. If Visual Studio 2015 Update 1 is already installed, Clang can be installed
        by selecting File &gt; New &gt; Project &gt; Visual C++ &gt; Cross Platform, select CodeGen support option.
    </p>
    <p>
        To use Clang open a Visual Studio 2015 AStyle Solution. Make the following change to all configurations:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>General &gt; Platform Toolset, select &quot;Clang 3.7 with Microsoft CodeGen&quot;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Make sure to hit &quot;Apply&quot; before editing other properties to let the project system load the corresponding
        toolset definition.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Update 1 preview release does not provide any support for automatic migration of values between Visual Studio
        2015 and Clang 3.7. The invalid properties must be fixed manually manually. These may change with subsequent Visual
        Studio updates.
    </p>
    <p>
        The properties that need changing in Visual Studio Update 1 are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>C/C++ &gt; General &gt; Debug Information Format, select &quot;Full Debug Information (DWARF2)&quot; for Debug
            or &quot;None&quot; for Release.</li>
        <li>C/C++ &gt; General &gt; Warning Level, select &quot;Enable All Warnings&quot;.</li>
        <li>C/C++ &gt; Code Generation &gt; Enable C++ Exceptions, select &quot;Yes&quot; for Debug or &quot;No&quot; for
            Release.</li>
        <li>C/C++ &gt; Precompiled Headers &gt; Precompiled Header, select &quot;Not Using Precompiled Headers&quot;.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The following is needed if you are building an executable instead of a static or dynamic library:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>C/C++ &gt; Preprocessor &gt; Preprocessor Definitions, add &quot;&nbsp;__STDC__=0&quot;. To remove the warnings
            this causes, C/C++ &gt; Command Line &gt; Additional Options, enter &quot;-Wno-macro-redefined&quot;.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The project should now compile and run.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Windows XP
    </h4>

    <p>
        The executable in the Windows distribution package is now compiled with a Visual Studio version that will no 
        longer work on Windows XP. Beginning with Visual Studio 2012, auto&#8209;vectorization tries to make loops run
        faster by automatically vectorizing the code. Auto&#8209;vectorization is on by default, there are no compiler
        switches, #pragmas, or hints. But it uses SSE instructions not available in Windows XP. Microsoft ended 
        support and updates for XP on April 8, 2014, and the usage share percentage continues to decrease.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are using XP, Artistic Style should be compiled on the XP machine. Compiling on XP with any 
        compiler should produce an XP executable.
    </p>
    <p>
        To compile on a non&#8209;XP machine for use on&nbsp; XP, using a compiler other than Visaul Studio should always
        produce an XP executable. Using Vusual Studio 2010 or earlier should always produce an XP executable. If 
        you are using Visual Studio 2012, 2013, or 2015 on a non&#8209;XP machine, do the following for the Artistic Style
        configuration you want to use:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>&quot;Windows XP Support for C++&quot; must be installed. It is available as an option in the Visual Studio install
            and can be installed as a modification to the original install.</li>
        <li>In the Artistic Style Properties, change General &gt; Platform Toolset, to &quot;Windows XP&quot;.</li>
        <li>In the Artistic Style Properties, change C/C++ &gt; Preprocessor &gt; Preprocessor Definitions to include 
            _USING_V110_SDK71_.</li>
        <li>Change other Properties if you want, such as Output Directory or Target Name.</li>
        <li>Compile. The output should be executable on Windows XP. It will also execute on the later versions of Windows.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>
        SourceForge
    </h4>

    <p>
        Recently, SourceForge began adding potentially unwanted programs (PUPs), also known as &quot;crapware&quot;, to
        software installers of certain applications. Some large projects have already left the site. Artistic Style does
        not use installer downloads and therefore was not affected by this. Downloads are in the form 
        of .zip or .tar.gz files. However, having the PUPs available on the host site affects the integrity of every
        application that uses the site.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is even more troubling is that the uBlock browser add&#8209;on, and all of its spin&#8209;offs, is now blocking
        access to the site by default. Even though Artistic Style has never used PUPs, the site is prevented from loading.
        The block can be easily removed, but may discourage some people from using the software. are.
    </p>
    <p>
        SourceForge is apparently taking steps to correct the situation. If this is not resolved fairly soon, Artistic
        Style will be relocated to another site. If this happens, I will give notification of the new site at the 
        current SourceForge address.

    <h3>Artistic Style 2.05&nbsp; (November 2014)</h3>

    <p>
        Release 2.05.1 (December 2014) is a maintenance release and no new features were added. A list of changes is in
        the Release Notes. The following information is for the original 2.05 release.
    </p>

    <p>
        A new bracket style option, &quot;style=vtk&quot;, has been added. It uses indented brackets, like Whitesmith,
        except opening brackets for classes, functions, and methods are not indented. A complete description of the VTK
        style is available at the &quot;Visualization Toolkit&quot; website (http://www.vtk.org/).
    </p>
    <p>
        A new preprocessor indent option "indent-preproc-block" will indent preprocessor block statements one additional
        indent. The block must be top-level, or included within a namespace, and there are restrictions on what can be
        indented.
        The option is described in the "Indentation Options" section of the documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new option, "dry-run", will run Artistic Style without updating the files. The report will be output as usual.
    </p>
    <p>
        Formatting of source code may now be disabled for portions of a program by embedding special comment tags in the
        program. These are described in a new &quot;Disable Formatting&quot; section of the documentation. They work the
        same as in other formatters. There are tags to disable formatting for a block of code, and a tag to disable formatting
        of a single line. This should allow any custom formatting to be retained.
    </p>
    <p>
        The product version number has been added to the filename of shared library (DLL) compiles. This will allow multiple
        versions of a shared library on the same system without conflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
        An attribute &#39;__attribute__ ((visibility (&quot;default&quot;)))&#39; has been added to exported functions
        on Linux shared libraries. This allows the option &quot;-fvisibility=hidden&quot; to be used on dynamic library
        compiles. According to the GNU documentation, &quot;Using this feature can very substantially improve linking
        and load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized code, provide near-perfect API export and prevent
        symbol clashes. It is strongly recommended that you use this in any shared objects you distribute.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
        Improvements have been made in the formatting of C++11 uniform initializers (enclosed by brackets). The opening
        bracket will not be space padded unless it is padded initially. The closing bracket will not be broken from the
        final line unless it is broken initially. And the known problems with uniform initializers in class constructors
        have been fixed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Windows compiler definition ASTYLE_NO_VCX (no Visual Studio exports) has been changed to ASTYLE_NO_EXPORTS.
        It is sometimes needed for static libraries on other compilers to prevent error and warning messages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Qt and Boost macros foreach, forever, Q_FOREACH, and Q_FOREVER will now be recognized as headers.
    </p>
    <p>
        The main documentation for Artistic Style is in HTML format. Until now there has not been a way to display it
        from the astyle console program. A new option, "html" or "-!" will display the help documentation in the default
        browser. This documentation is more complete than the astyle "help" option. It includes examples, and has an index
        for easier navigation. Since astyle is typically run from a script this should allow an easy way to access the
        documentation. The option is available only from the command line.
    </p>
    <p>
        The new "html" option assumes the documentation is installed in the standard install path. This is /usr/share/doc/astyle/html
        for Linux and the path %programfiles%\AStyle\doc for Windows. If it is installed to a different directory, use
        the variation "html=&lt;actual_install_path&gt;astyle.html. This option can also be used to open other HTML files.
        More information is in the "Command Line Only" section of the documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "html" option on Linux uses the script "xdg-open" from the install package "xdg-utils" to find the default
        browser. This should be available on most systems. &nbsp;If it is not available on your system you can file a
        bug report requesting a change. It would be helpful if you could determine how it is done before filing the report.
        You can also file a bug report if the documentation is not installed to the above "default" directories. The HTML
        documentation takes quite a bit of effort to maintain and I would like to make it easily available.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "help" option has been changed to send the output to stdout instead of stderr. This will allow piping and
        redirection of the output. A common way to use the option on Linux is "astyle --help&nbsp;|&nbsp;less", which
        will page the display. The "version" option has also been changed to stdout.
    </p>
    <p>
        A shared library error handler argument has been changed from &quot;char*&quot; to &quot;const char*&quot;. In
        some cases this may cause compile errors in a user program until the references have been changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Indent Style" topic on Wikipedia states that the "ANSI" style refers to K&amp;R style brackets
        and not Allman style as used by Artistic Style. The option "style=ansi" is therefore being depreciated and will
        be removed in a future release. Use one of the other long options instead (style=allman, style=bsd, or style=break).
    </p>
    <p>
        Some of the documentation has been removed from the distribution package. It still contains all files needed to
        install and run Artistic Style. The included files can be used without an Internet connection.
    </p>
    <p>
        There are now build files available for Xcode on Mac. The makefile is still available for those who want it. Both
        now use the LLVM Clang compiler. There has been a
        change to the makefile debug locations to make them similar to Xcode. The &quot;Install Instructions&quot; have
        been updated for both.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Python Example in the Developer Information now supports Iron Python. The
        programming instructions are sometimes different since the ctypes module works differently. The example script
        documents the differences. If you use Python Tools for Visual Studio, it now installs in the Express editions
        (beginning with release 2.1). Node.js can also be installed in Visual Studio Express.
    </p>
    <p>
        The executable in the Windows distribution package is now compiled with Visual Studio 2013 and will no longer
        work on XP. If you are using XP, Artistic Style will need to be recompiled on the XP machine.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/news/vs2013-community-vs" target="_blank" title="open new window">Visual
            Studio Community Edition</a> has been released. It is free, combines all of the Express editions into a single
        development environment, and allows the addition of Visual Studio extensions. There is an
        <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/2f3f04cd-2866-4e47-a671-d1cc9cc3fb02" target="_blank" title="open new window">
            AStyle Extension</a> available for installation. It has a graphic interface, adds menu entries, and can be
        used from within Visual Studio. To install it search the &quot;Extensions and Updates&quot;, &quot;Online&quot;
        entry for &quot;astyle&quot;.

    <h3>Artistic Style 2.04&nbsp; (November 2013)</h3>

    <p>
        With a new Artistic Style release some unchanged source files will be formatted because of changes to Artistic
        Style. You may want to format your source before making program changes in order to bring it up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new programming language, Objective&#8209;C, has been added to Artistic Style. Four new options, "align&#8209;method&#8209;colon",
        "pad&#8209;method&#8209;colon=", "pad&#8209;method&#8209;prefix", and "unpad&#8209;method&#8209;prefix" have been
        added to format the methods. The options are described in a new "Objective&#8209;C" section in the documentation.
        These new options affect only Objective&#8209;C source code. They have no effect on the other programming languages.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because of the longer continuation indents sometimes needed for Objective&#8209;C, the option "max-instatement-indent"
        may need to be increased. If you are not getting the paren and square bracket alignment you want, try increasing
        this value. The default minimum is 40 and the maximum is 120.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new bracket style option, "style=google", has been added. It uses attached brackets and indents the class access
        modifiers one-half indent.&nbsp; A complete description of the Google style is available at the google&#8209;styleguide
        website (https://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/). The website has standards for several programming languages
        along with a python program to verify the style and an emacs script for using the style.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new indent option "indent-modifiers" will indent class access modifiers (public, protected, or 'private) one-half
        indent. The rest of the class is not indented. It is described in the "Indentation Options" section of the documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Four new bracket modify options, "attach-namespaces", "attach-classes", "attach-inlines", and "attach-extern-c",
        can be used to modify your selected bracket style. They are described in a new "Bracket Modify Options" section
        of the documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new option, "remove-brackets", will remove brackets from conditional statements. The statement must be a single
        statement on a single line. It is described in the "Formatting Options" section of the documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new option, "indent-preproc-cond", will indent preprocessor conditional statements (#if #elif, #else, #endif).
        It is described in the "Indentation Options" section of the documentation. The option "indent-preprocessor" has
        been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use "indent-preproc-define" instead. The processing of
        preprocessor #define statements has not changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new option, "remove-comment-prefix", will remove a leading '*' from multi-line comments. It is described in
        the "Formatting Options" section of the documentation. With the syntax coloring of modern editors a leading '*'
        for comment lines is not as useful as it once was. The current trend is toward code that is easier to maintain.
        The idea is that a style that is hard to maintain will discourage modification and updating. The converted style
        should retain most of the formatting within the comment and result in a comment that is easier to maintain. For
        consistency the option also indents multi-line comments that are not preceded by the '*'. This may slightly modify
        the indentation of any commented-out code.
    </p>
    <p>
        The option "pad-first-paren-out" was fixed to not pad if the following paren is empty. This makes the option consistent
        with "pad-paren-out". To fix empty parens that have been padded run with the option "unpad-paren" in addition
        to "pad-first-paren-out". This needs to be done only once.
    </p>
    <p>
        Processing of C++11 raw string literals has been added.
    </p>
    <p>
        The compiler definition ASTYLE_NO_VCX (no Visual Studio exports) has been changed to ASTYLE_NO_EXPORTS and can
        be used with any Windows compiler. The Clang compiler needs this option to avoid errors on dynamic libraries.
        It removes the "__declspec(dllexport)"
        definition from exported functions. Linux compilers do not use this.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new shared object (DLL) entry point, AStyleMainUtf16, has been added for processing C# UTF-16 strings. C# does
        not have built in functions for converting the UTF-16 strings to UTF-8. This entry point will accept UTF-16 strings,
        format the source code, and return UTF-16 strings. The error handling function and version number still use UTF-8
        strings. The C# example program in the "Developer Information" shows the new calling procedure. Changes from the
        previous release are marked in the example.
    </p>
    <p>
        C# strings are UTF-16 on both Windows and Linux. C# does not use the UTF-32 wchar_t strings on Linux. Qt also
        uses UTF-16 on both Windows and Linux, but has built in UTF-8 conversion functions. Qt strings can be converted
        to UTF-8 by Qt, or the new entry point can be used. There may be other "managed code" applications on Linux that
        use UTF-16.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Links" page has two new sections for links mentioned in previous versions of Artistic Style. It links to
        free software and other information.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Developer Information" section has a new example and download for calling Artistic Style from an Objective&#8209;C
        program. Since it is another "C" language the only thing needed is to link the program with a library build of
        Artistic Style. The example was developed on Windows and Linux using the GNUstep project. Since the example is
        a console program the problems with the GNUstep GUI have been avoided. It has not been tested on a Mac, but should
        be close to working. The "Developer Information" section also has new page for "Objective&#8209;C on Windows and
        Linux" which has information on compiling and running the example on those systems.
    </p>
    <p>
        The executable included in the Windows distribution was compiled with Visual Studio 2010 (platform toolset v100).
        Higher releases contain dependencies on Windows API functions that exist only on Windows Vista, Windows 7, and
        Windows 8. This means that applications built with a Visual Studio 2012 C++ compiler would fail to load and execute
        on Windows XP.

        If you are using Windows Vista or higher, and have a Visual Studio 2012 or higher compiler available, recompiling
        will probably result in faster execution. If you use a compiler other than Visual Studio, you can probably get
        better execution by compiling using the C++11 standards. Artistic Style uses a lot of string vectors and the new
        move semantics will probably result in faster execution.

    <h3>Artistic Style 2.03&nbsp; (April 2013)</h3>

    <p>
        With a new Artistic Style release some unchanged source files will be formatted because of changes to Artistic
        Style. You may want to format your source before making program changes in order to bring it up to date.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new option, "max-code-length=#" or "xC#", will limit the length of code on a line. A new option "break&#8209;after&#8209;logical",
        or "xL", will modify a line break for conditionals. See the documentation for details.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new option, "pad-first-paren-out" or "xd", will pad only the first paren in a series on the outside. See the
        documentation for details.
    </p>
    <p>
        A new option, "indent=force-tab-tab=#" or "xT#", will allow force tab indents with a tab length that is different
        than the indent length. See the documentation for details.
    </p>
    <p>
        The short option for delete-empty-lines has changed from "xd" to "xe".
    </p>
    <p>
        The C++11 standard for range-based "for" loops, "enum" with a base type, and rvalue references is now supported.
        The formatting of rvalue references is determined from the existing &quot;align-pointer&quot; and &quot;align-reference&quot;
        options.
    </p>
    <p>
        Closing the ending angle brackets of templates is now allowed by the C++11 standard. A new option, &quot;close-templates&quot;
        or "xy", will close the whitespace in the angle brackets of template definitions. Be sure your compiler supports
        this before making the changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        The C/C++ keyword 'extern "C"' in a preprocessor no longer causes an extra indent.
    </p>
    <p>
        Formatting of C++/CLI managed pointers (the &#39;^&#39; character) has been added to the &quot;align-pointer&quot;
        option.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;The breaking of switch &quot;default&quot; statements has been fixed. The &quot;default&quot; statements
        that have been incorrectly broken will be fixed in this release.
    </p>
    <p>
        The byte order mark (BOM) has been removed from ASLocalizer.cpp for all platforms. The encoding of the file is
        UTF-8. Many Windows editors can now recognize UTF-8 encoding without the BOM. Visual Studio has an option that
        needs to be set. With others. such as CodeBlocks, identification is automatic. On Linux, UTF-8 is the default
        encoding.
    </p>
    <p>
        Translations have been added for Dutch, Finnish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Swedish,
        and Ukrainian. The translations were done with an automated translation program, Google Translate, so they may
        not be the best translation possible. The translations are at the end of ASLocalizer.cpp in the form of an English&#8209;Translation
        pair. If you correct a translation, send the source as a bug report and it will be included in the next release.
        To add a language, see "Internationalization" in the "General Information" section of the documentation. Send
        the addition as a bug report and it will be included in the next release.
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a new Linux makefile for the Clang Compiler. Clang is a free compiler can be installed as a package on
        many Linux distributions. Some of its features are fast compiles, low memory use, expressive diagnostic messages,
        and GCC compatibility. It includes a static analyzer tool that finds potential bugs in your source code. An experimental
        version can be installed on a Windows platform. There is more information in the Install Information documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Visual Studio automatically creates an import library and an export file when you link a program that contains
        exports. It will do this for even a static library if it contains a __declspec(dllexport) definition. The Artistic
        Style library (ASTYLE_LIB) build contains such exports which causes an import library and export file to be created
        when they may not be needed. A new preprocessor definition, ASTYLE_NO_VCX (no Visual Studio exports) can be declared
        to eliminate the files from the output. Use this only for static libraries or when the AStyle source is included
        in the compile. Do NOT use this when compiled as a shared (dynamic) library. It is effective only for Visual Studio
        2012. It will NOT work with previous versions. It has no effect with other compilers since they require a separate
        option to create the import library and export files.
    </p>
    <p>
        The executable included in the Windows distribution was compiled with Visual Studio 2010 (platform toolset v100).
        Visual Studio 2012 (platform toolset v110) contains dependencies on Windows API functions that exist only on Windows
        Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. This means that applications built with a Visual Studio 2012 C++ compiler would
        fail to load and execute on Windows XP. Artistic Style was therefore compiled with Visual Studio 2010 to work
        on computers using Windows XP.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are using Windows Vista or higher, and have the Visual Studio 2012 compiler available, recompiling with
        Visual Studio 2012 will probably result in faster execution. The Windows distribution has Visual Studio 2012 project
        files available.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you use a compiler other than Visual Studio, you can probably get better execution by compiling using the C++11
        standards. Artistic Style uses a lot of string vectors and the new move semantics will probably result in faster
        execution. (To use C++11 on GCC and MinGW use the option --std=c++0x). This may change on future compiler releases.).
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Developer Information" page has a new example and download for calling Artistic Style from a Python script.
        It will run with both Python 2 and Python 3. Using Python 3 shows an example of formatting a Unicode string with
        Artistic Style. Unicode strings must be encoded to UTF-8 before formatting and decoded back to Unicode afterward.
        The example script shows the technique for doing this. It also shows how to set up the function pointers and allocate
        memory in Python.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you use Visual Studio on Windows, it can now be used for Python development. Python Tools for Visual Studio
        (PTVS) is a free and open source plug-in for Visual Studio 2010 that supports Python and Iron Python. Other interpreters
        such Jython can be added. It can be easily switched between Python versions or different interpreters. But the
        best thing is the Visual Studio debugging support using the .NET debugger and the normal Visual Studio debugger.
        It enables you to set break points, step through functions, change the current statement, inspect local variables,
        and perform other operations while debugging. It is best to use it with a project file, a minor irritation for
        single page scripts. And there are some minor bugs. But overall it works quite well.
