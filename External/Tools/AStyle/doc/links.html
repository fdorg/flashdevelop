    <h3>Graphical User Interfaces</h3>

    <p>
        Artistic Style is a command line program and, as such, does not give you a chance to review the effect of different
        options before formatting the source code. The following Graphical User Interface program will allow you to review
        the changes before the code is updated. They allow you to select the options you want without actually updating
        the source.

        will work under Linux using WINE. Everything done in the editor is undo-able, including formatting of the entire
        document. Documents can be reviewed and reformatted using different options. It can be executed from most development
        environments and will open the currently selected document.<br />
        <strong>Here are the links for downloading version 2.05.1 of 
         <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/astyle/files/OldFiles/AStyleWin/AStyleWin_1.9.zip" target="_blank" title="open new window">

        <a href="http://universalindent.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" title="open new window"><strong>Universal Indent
            Gui</strong></a> is a cross platform GUI that supports several code formatters. The main feature is a live
        preview to show how the selected formatting options affect the source code. This allows review and testing of
        the various options before formatting a file. It can be used with a sample file or with your actual source code.
        It is a good way to try out the options from various indentation programs. This program is not always kept up
        to date. Be sure to check the AStyle release before relying on the results.

        are instructions for adding x64 platforms to Visual Studio Express 2010. Express editions after 2010 have the

        toolset v100). Visual Studio 2012 (platform toolset v110) and higher contains dependencies on Windows API functions
        that exist only on Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. This means that applications built with Visual Studio
        2012 and higher would fail to load and execute on Windows XP.
