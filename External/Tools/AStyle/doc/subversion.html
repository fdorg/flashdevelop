    <h1>Artistic Style Subversion Repository</h1>

    <p>
        &nbsp;
    </p>

    <h3>Artistic Style</h3>

    <p>
        The latest development source is in the Artistic Style repository at SourceForge. It can be checked out using
        Subversion. The source code is under development and some changes take several weeks to complete. The intermediate
        source files have not been through the extensive system tests that are done before each release. Use reasonable
        precautions when using source code from the repository.
    </p>
    <p>
        The current version is in the "trunk/AStyle" branch of the repository. The file and directory names are case sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        <strong>svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyle"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyle"</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/astyle/code/HEAD/tree/">browse the subversion repository</a>.
        The current development release is in the "trunk" directory. This gives you a view into the current status of
        the project's code without actually checking-out the files.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp;
    </p>

    <h3>Other Projects</h3>

    <p>
        Two additional Artistic Style projects are available in the repository. They are not maintained for the general
        public but are available if you want them. You may have to create your own project files and scripts to use them.
        These projects require the Artistic Style project above. They are an extension that requires the Artistic Style
        source. All projects, and any additional source required, should be installed in the same top level folder.
    </p>

    <h4>AStyleDev</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleDev contains the development files that are made available in the "Developer Information" section. Refer
        to that section for more information.
    </p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyleDev"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyledev"
    </p>

    <h4>AStyleTest</h4>

    <p>
        AStyleTest contains the unit test programs and test scripts for Artistic Style. There are over 2000 tests in the
        main test program.
    </p>
    <p>
        A sample checkout is:<br />
        svn&nbsp; checkout&nbsp; "https://svn.code.sf.net/p/astyle/code/trunk/AStyleTest"&nbsp; "$HOME/astyletest"
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to the Artistic Style source the test program requires
        <a href="http://code.google.com/p/googlemock/"
            target="_blank" title="open new window">Google Mock</a>. This is the Google multi-platform framework for writing
        C++ unit tests. The main Artistic Style test project, AStyleTest, actually uses &quot;integration&quot; tests
        instead of &quot;unit&quot; tests. This type of testing can be effective for programs that were written without
        unit tests to begin with.
